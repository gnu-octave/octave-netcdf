@node Installing and loading
@chapter Installing and loading
@cindex Installing and loading

The toolkit must be installed and then loaded to be used.

It can be installed in @acronym{GNU} Octave directly from the website,
or can be installed in an off-line mode via a downloaded tarball.

The toolkit has a dependency on the netcdf library (@url{https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}),
so it must be installed in order to successfully install the toolkit.

The toolkit must be then be loaded once per each @acronym{GNU} Octave session in order to use its functionality.

@section Online Direct install
@cindex Online install
With an internet connection available, the package can be installed from
octave-forge using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install -forge netcdf
@end example

The latest released version of the toolkit will be downloaded and installed.

@section Off-line install
@cindex Off-line install
With the toolkit package already downloaded, and in the current directory when running
@acronym{GNU} Octave, the package can be installed using the following command within @acronym{GNU} Octave:

@example
pkg install netcdf-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example

@section Loading
@cindex Loading
Regardless of the method of installing the toolkit, in order to use its functions,
the toolkit must be loaded using the pkg load command:

@example
pkg load netcdf
@end example

The toolkit must be loaded on each @acronym{GNU} Octave session.

@node Basic Usage Overview
@chapter Basic Usage Overview
@cindex Basic Usage Overview

The toolkit provides high and level functionality for reading and
writing NetCDF format files.

@section High level functionality
@cindex  High level functionality

The toolkit provides the following high level functions:
@itemize @bullet
@item
nccreate     
@item
ncdisp       
@item
ncinfo       
@item
ncreadatt    
@item
ncread       
@item
ncwriteatt   
@item
ncwrite      
@item
ncwriteschema
@end itemize

@section Low level functionality
@cindex  Low level functionality

The package aims to implement the netcdf interface of MATLAB in GNU Octave, however @acronym{GNU} Octave
does not support the import function.

Functions can be used in netcdf_functionname format, or an emulated import can be done using the
import_netcdf script so that functions can be used in netcdf.functionname format.
